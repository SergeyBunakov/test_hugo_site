[comment]: <> (Description of the Linkitivity project...)

Joe asks:
---------
What’s the Difference Between summary and description in Front Matter?
---------
The difference is mostly up to you. In some cases, they might be the same content. However, the description field is great for providing a description of the page optimized for search engines or social sharing, while the summary field gives you a chance to create a short summary of the content you’ll display on other parts of the site. As you’ll see later in this chapter, Hugo can automatically generate a page’s summary, but the summary field in the front matter overrides that, giving you more control.
